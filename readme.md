# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree : Project 3 

This project provides us to apply stastical approach in taking a decision . In this project I was given data of users for a e-commerce 
company where some users visited a old page and some users visited a new page ( re-designed page) .  I was tasked to find out using the 
A/B approach whether the company should change the design of their website subject to the sales of both the pages. <br>
